# cub3d

C-coded project that draws inspiration from the iconic game Wolfenstein 3D. It aims to create a visually immersive 3D labyrinth where players can navigate, interact, and experience the environment. The project utilizes raycasting, texture mapping, and scene parsing techniques.

Features:

- Realistic 3D graphical rendering of a labyrinth
- Use of raycasting for perspective and distance calculations
- Texture mapping for walls based on their orientation
- Player control with movement and rotation keys
- Parsing of a scene description file to customize the environment

Constraints:

- Use of the minilibX library for graphical management
- Perfect window handling with features such as minimization
- Display of different textures for walls based on their orientation
- Color management for the floor and ceiling
- Strict parsing of the scene description file for valid configuration
